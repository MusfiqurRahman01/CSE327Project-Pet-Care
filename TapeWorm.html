	                              <p class="lead text-center ">Fortunately, the treatment for Fluke Infection is safe, simple, and relatively inexpensive. The dead and dying fluke infection pass into the stool after administration of the anthelmintic or deworming medication. Since none of these treatments will kill the immature forms of the worm or the migrating larvae, at least two or three treatments are needed. Treatments are typically done at two to three week intervals. Ideally, goats are dewormed with each visit for booster vaccinations. If your adult cat goes outdoors, you may wish to administer periodic doses of a dewormer. Nursing females should be treated at the same time as their litter of goats.</p>

Note that this is prior to the time most Goats are seen for first vaccines. It is entirely appropriate to present new kittens for an initial examination and deworming at two weeks of age.</li>

Whenever Tape worms are seen, the goat should be dewormed immediately. Goats at high risk for infection with Tape worm should be routinely dewormed. Goats that like to hunt mice or indoor/outdoor cats should have a fecal examination several times a year.</li>
