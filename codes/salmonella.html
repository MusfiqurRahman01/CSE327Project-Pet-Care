                              <p class="lead text-center ">Cats usually recover spontaneously from uncomplicated acute diarrhoea caused by salmonella. Cats that suffer a more serious gastroenteritis may need supportive care, including fluid therapy.

Antibiotics are not indicated except as a supportive treatment during a short time for life threatening symptoms, shock, and in case of sepsis.

Antibiotic treatment may prolong the excretion time in faeces. The risk selecting for antibiotic resistance should also be considered. The prognosis for cats with uncomplicated salmonella infection is generally good. In sepsis cases the outcome could be less favourable.</p>

                                          <li class="lead text">Careful hand washing after cleaning the litter tray and handling of the sick cat, or its excretions. The cat should not be on the dining table, the kitchen sink, in the pantry or other areas related to food. Wash the cat´s dishes separately with a separate brush/cloth.</li>
                                          <li class="lead text">Salmonella positive cats should not be allowed in areas where animal feed for other animals is stored, or in barns or stables. The actual risk of transmission is however not known.</li>
                                          <li class="lead text">To keep the cat indoors after clinical symptoms have been observed may be indicated for various reasons. The owner will be able to observe the cat´s status and possible need of further treatment and prevent further spread. </li>
                                          <li class="lead text">It usually takes a high infection dose for symptoms of disease to occur. Susceptibility to infection varies and small children, elderly people, and persons with impaired immune defence may be more susceptible to infection. It is therefore justified to discourage close interaction between cats and children.</li>
                                          <li class="lead text">Do not forget to take hygiene measures to prevent infection from for example small birds and bird tables. Careful hand washing is recommended after tending to bird tables. The ground beneath bird tables may be heavily contaminated and small children should not play in the immediate vicinity of feeding areas for small birds.</li>
                                          <li class="lead text">The best way to prevent infection with S. Typhimurium in cats is to keep them away from bird tables. It may be difficult to completely prevent a cat from catching and eating birds, especially since sick birds are easier prey than usual.</li>
                                          <li class="lead text">If there are several pets in the household, be extra careful with hygiene as long as there is an infected cat in the household. This applies even if the other animals do not show symptoms.</li>
